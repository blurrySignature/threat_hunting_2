#### 1. Basic Building Blocks

In its simplest form, R can be used as an interactive calculator. Type
5 + 7 and press Enter.

``` r
5 + 7
```

    [1] 12

To assign the result of 5 + 7 to a new variable called x, you type x \<-
5 + 7. This can be read as ‘x gets 5 plus 7’. Give it a try now.

``` r
x <- 5 + 7
x
```

    [1] 12

Now, store the result of x - 3 in a new variable called y

``` r
y <- x - 3
y
```

    [1] 9

The easiest way to create a vector is with the c() function, which
stands for ‘concatenate’ or ‘combine’. To create a vector containing the
numbers 1.1, 9, and 3.14, type c(1.1, 9, 3.14). Try it now and store the
result in a variable called z.

``` r
z <- c(1.1, 9, 3.14)
z
```

    [1] 1.10 9.00 3.14

Anytime you have questions about a particular function, you can access
R’s built-in help files via the `?` command. For example, if you want
more information on the c() function, type ?c without the parentheses
that normally follow a function name. Give it a try.

``` r
?c
```

You can combine vectors to make a new vector. Create a new vector that
contains z, 555, then z again in that order. Don’t assign this vector to
a new variable, so that we can just see the result immediately.

``` r
c(z, 555, z)
```

    [1]   1.10   9.00   3.14 555.00   1.10   9.00   3.14

Numeric vectors can be used in arithmetic expressions. Type the
following to see what happens: z \* 2 + 100.

``` r
z * 2 + 100
```

    [1] 102.20 118.00 106.28

Take the square root of z - 1 and assign it to a new variable called
my_sqrt.

``` r
my_sqrt <- sqrt(z - 1)
my_sqrt
```

    [1] 0.3162278 2.8284271 1.4628739

Now, create a new variable called my_div that gets the value of z
divided by my_sqrt.

``` r
my_div <- z / my_sqrt
my_div
```

    [1] 3.478505 3.181981 2.146460

To see another example of how this vector ‘recycling’ works, try adding
c(1, 2, 3, 4) and c(0, 10). Don’t worry about saving the result in a new
variable.

``` r
c(1, 2, 3, 4) + c(0, 10)
```

    [1]  1 12  3 14

In many programming environments, the up arrow will cycle through
previous commands. Try hitting the up arrow on your keyboard until you
get to this command (z \* 2 + 100), then change 100 to 1000 and hit
Enter. If the up arrow doesn’t work for you, just type the corrected
command.

``` r
z * 2 + 1000
```

    [1] 1002.20 1018.00 1006.28

#### 2. Workspace and Files

Determine which directory your R session is using as its current working
directory using getwd().

``` r
getwd()
```

    [1] "C:/Users/mrcee/RStudioProjects/threat_hunting_2/lab_1"

List all the objects in your local workspace using ls().

``` r
ls()
```

    [1] "my_div"  "my_sqrt" "x"       "y"       "z"      

Assign 9 to x using x \<- 9.

``` r
x <- 9
```

Now take a look at objects that are in your workspace using ls().

``` r
ls()
```

    [1] "my_div"  "my_sqrt" "x"       "y"       "z"      

List all the files in your working directory using list.files() or
dir().

``` r
dir()
```

    [1] "lab_1.qmd"       "lab_1.rmarkdown" "README.md"      

As we go through this lesson, you should be examining the help page for
each new function. Check out the help page for list.files with the
command ?list.files.

``` r
?list.files
```

Use the args() function to determine the arguments to list.files().

``` r
args(list.files)
```

    function (path = ".", pattern = NULL, all.files = FALSE, full.names = FALSE, 
        recursive = FALSE, ignore.case = FALSE, include.dirs = FALSE, 
        no.. = FALSE) 
    NULL

Assign the value of the current working directory to a variable called
“old.dir”.

``` r
old.dir <- getwd()
old.dir
```

    [1] "C:/Users/mrcee/RStudioProjects/threat_hunting_2/lab_1"

Use dir.create() to create a directory in the current working directory
called “testdir”.

``` r
dir.create("testdir")
```

Set your working directory to “testdir” with the setwd() command.

``` r
setwd("testdir")
```

Create a file in your working directory called “mytest.R” using the
file.create() function.

``` r
file.create("mytest.R")
```

    [1] TRUE

This should be the only file in this newly created directory. Let’s
check this by listing all the files in the current directory.

``` r
dir()
```

    [1] "lab_1.qmd"       "lab_1.rmarkdown" "mytest.R"        "README.md"      
    [5] "testdir"        

Check to see if “mytest.R” exists in the working directory using the
file.exists() function.

``` r
file.exists("mytest.R")
```

    [1] TRUE

Access information about the file “mytest.R” by using file.info().

``` r
file.info("mytest.R")
```

             size isdir mode               mtime               ctime
    mytest.R    0 FALSE  666 2023-09-15 00:14:29 2023-09-15 00:14:29
                           atime exe
    mytest.R 2023-09-15 00:14:29  no

Change the name of the file “mytest.R” to “mytest2.R” by using
file.rename().

``` r
file.rename("mytest.R", "mytest2.R")
```

    [1] TRUE

Make a copy of “mytest2.R” called “mytest3.R” using file.copy().

``` r
file.copy("mytest2.R", "mytest3.R")
```

    [1] TRUE

Provide the relative path to the file “mytest3.R” by using file.path().

``` r
file.path("mytest3.R")
```

    [1] "mytest3.R"

You can use file.path to construct file and directory paths that are
independent of the operating system your R code is running on. Pass
‘folder1’ and ‘folder2’ as arguments to file.path to make a
platform-independent pathname.

``` r
file.path("folder1", "folder2")
```

    [1] "folder1/folder2"

Take a look at the documentation for dir.create by entering ?dir.create
. Notice the ‘recursive’ argument. In order to create nested
directories, ‘recursive’ must be set to TRUE.

``` r
?dir.create
```

Create a directory in the current working directory called “testdir2”
and a subdirectory for it called “testdir3”, all in one command by using
dir.create() and file.path().

``` r
dir.create(file.path('testdir2', 'testdir3'), recursive = TRUE)
```

Go back to your original working directory using setwd(). (Recall that
we created the variable old.dir with the full path for the orginal
working directory at the start of these questions.)

``` r
setwd(old.dir)
```

#### 3. Sequences of Numbers

The simplest way to create a sequence of numbers in R is by using the
`:` operator. Type 1:20 to see how it works.

``` r
1:20
```

     [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

That gave us every integer between (and including) 1 and 20. We could
also use it to create a sequence of real numbers. For example, try
pi:10.

``` r
pi:10
```

    [1] 3.141593 4.141593 5.141593 6.141593 7.141593 8.141593 9.141593

What happens if we do 15:1? Give it a try to find out.

``` r
15:1
```

     [1] 15 14 13 12 11 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1

Remember that if you have questions about a particular R function, you
can access its documentation with a question mark followed by the
function name: ?function_name_here. However, in the case of an operator
like the colon used above, you must enclose the symbol in backticks like
this: ?`:`. (NOTE: The backtick (\`) key is generally located in the top
left corner of a keyboard, above the Tab key. If you don’t have a
backtick key, you can use regular quotes.)

``` r
?':'
```

The most basic use of seq() does exactly the same thing as the `:`
operator. Try seq(1, 20) to see this.

``` r
seq(1, 20)
```

     [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

This gives us the same output as 1:20. However, let’s say that instead
we want a vector of numbers ranging from 0 to 10, incremented by | 0.5.
seq(0, 10, by=0.5) does just that. Try it out.

``` r
seq(0, 10, by=0.5)
```

     [1]  0.0  0.5  1.0  1.5  2.0  2.5  3.0  3.5  4.0  4.5  5.0  5.5  6.0  6.5  7.0
    [16]  7.5  8.0  8.5  9.0  9.5 10.0

Or maybe we don’t care what the increment is and we just want a sequence
of 30 numbers between 5 and 10. seq(5, 10, length=30) does the trick.
Give it a shot now and store the result in a new variable called my_seq.

``` r
my_seq <- seq(5, 10, length=30)
```

To confirm that my_seq has length 30, we can use the length() function.
Try it now.

``` r
length(my_seq)
```

    [1] 30

Let’s pretend we don’t know the length of my_seq, but we want to
generate a sequence of integers from 1 to N, where N represents the
length of the my_seq vector. In other words, we want a new vector (1, 2,
3, …) that is the same length as my_seq. There are several ways we could
do this. One possibility is to combine the `:` operator and the length()
function like this: 1:length(my_seq). Give that a try.

``` r
1:length(my_seq)
```

     [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
    [26] 26 27 28 29 30

Another option is to use seq(along.with = my_seq). Give that a try

``` r
seq(along.with = my_seq)
```

     [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
    [26] 26 27 28 29 30

However, as is the case with many common tasks, R has a separate
built-in function for this purpose called seq_along(). Type
seq_along(my_seq) to see it in action.

``` r
seq_along(my_seq)
```

     [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
    [26] 26 27 28 29 30

One more function related to creating sequences of numbers is rep(),
which stands for ‘replicate’. Let’s look at a few uses. If we’re
interested in creating a vector that contains 40 zeros, we can use
rep(0, times = 40). Try it out.

``` r
rep(0, times=40)
```

     [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    [39] 0 0

If instead we want our vector to contain 10 repetitions of the vector
(0, 1, 2), we can do rep(c(0, 1, 2), times = 10). Go ahead.

``` r
rep(c(1, 2, 3), times=10)
```

     [1] 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3

Finally, let’s say that rather than repeating the vector (0, 1, 2) over
and over again, we want our vector to contain 10 zeros, then 10 ones,
then 10 twos. We can do this with the `each` argument. Try rep(c(0, 1,
2), each = 10).

``` r
rep(c(0, 1, 2), each=10)
```

     [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2

#### 4. Vectors

First, create a numeric vector num_vect that contains the values 0.5,
55, -10, and 6.

``` r
num_vect <- c(0.5, 55, -10, 6)
```

Now, create a variable called tf that gets the result of num_vect \< 1,
which is read as ‘num_vect is less than 1’.

``` r
tf <- num_vect < 1
tf
```

    [1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE

Let’s try another. Type num_vect \>= 6 without assigning the result to a
new variable.

``` r
num_vect >= 6
```

    [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE

Create a character vector that contains the following words: “My”,
“name”, “is”. Remember to enclose each word in its own set of double
quotes, so that R knows they are character strings. Store the vector in
a variable called my_char.

``` r
my_char <- c("My", "name", "is")
my_char
```

    [1] "My"   "name" "is"  

Type paste(my_char, collapse = ” “) now. Make sure there’s a space
between the double quotes in the `collapse` argument. You’ll see why in
a second.

``` r
paste(my_char, collapse = " ")
```

    [1] "My name is"

To add (or ‘concatenate’) your name to the end of my_char, use the c()
function like this: c(my_char, “your_name_here”). Place your name in
double quotes where I’ve put “your_name_here”. Try it now, storing the
result in a new variable called my_name.

``` r
my_name <- c(my_char, "Swirl")
my_name
```

    [1] "My"    "name"  "is"    "Swirl"

Now, use the paste() function once more to join the words in my_name
together into a single character string. Don’t forget to say collapse =
” “!

``` r
paste(my_name, collapse = " ")
```

    [1] "My name is Swirl"

In the simplest case, we can join two character vectors that are each of
length 1 (i.e. join two words). Try paste(“Hello”, “world!”, sep = ” “),
where the `sep` argument tells R that we want to separate the joined
elements with a single space.

``` r
paste("Hello", "world!", sep = " ")
```

    [1] "Hello world!"

For a slightly more complicated example, we can join two vectors, each
of length 3. Use paste() to join the integer vector 1:3 with the
character vector c(“X”, “Y”, “Z”). This time, use sep = “” to leave no
space between the joined elements.

``` r
paste(c(1:3), c("X", "Y", "Z"), sep = "")
```

    [1] "1X" "2Y" "3Z"

Vector recycling! Try paste(LETTERS, 1:4, sep = “-”), where LETTERS is a
predefined variable in R containing a character vector of all 26 letters
in the English alphabet.

``` r
paste(LETTERS, 1:4, sep = "-")
```

     [1] "A-1" "B-2" "C-3" "D-4" "E-1" "F-2" "G-3" "H-4" "I-1" "J-2" "K-3" "L-4"
    [13] "M-1" "N-2" "O-3" "P-4" "Q-1" "R-2" "S-3" "T-4" "U-1" "V-2" "W-3" "X-4"
    [25] "Y-1" "Z-2"
